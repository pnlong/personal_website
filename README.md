# Notes

- Make sure that images that are used in the homepage slideshow are the same dimensions (or at least aspect ratio)!
- For any new project entry, include a .gif under `.project-cover-image` (which can be made at [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/video-speed)) and a still under `.project-cover-image-still` -- either a .png or .jpg, which is usually the first frame of the .gif, which can be made at [onlinegiftools.com](https://onlinegiftools.com/extract-gif-frames). The alternative is to only include a `.project-cover-image` and instead of setting the `style="background-image:url('');"`, set it as `style="background-color:rgb();"` and then write a related emoji inside the `div`.
